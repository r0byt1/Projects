# Python Learning Journey & Project Evolution 🚀

### Welcome to my Python repository! I created this space to document my growth as a developer and to showcase the evolution of my coding logic, from foundational scripts to more complex object-oriented programs.

## 📈 My Evolution as a Learner
As a learner, my goal is to master Python by building practical tools and games. This repository tracks my progress through three distinct stages:
  1. Foundations: Learning syntax, loops, and conditional logic.
  2. Structural Logic: Organizing code into reusable functions and manageable file structures.
  3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implementing classes and methods to create scalable code.

# 📂 Featured Projects
## 🕹️ Rock Paper Scissors
* Purpose: A classic game to practice complex if-else branching and user input validation.
* Key Learning: Managing game states and ensuring the program can handle unexpected user inputs gracefully.
## 📐 Draw Rectangle (OOP Practice)
* Purpose: A geometry tool that uses Classes to calculate area and perimeter, and even "draws" shapes in the console.
* Key Learning: This project represents my shift into Object-Oriented Programming. I focused on encapsulation—keeping the logic for the "Rectangle" object separate from the main execution script.
