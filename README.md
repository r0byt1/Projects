Python Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Python repository!

This repository contains projects I’ve built while learning Python. It shows my progress as a student, starting with basic programming concepts and gradually moving into Object-Oriented Programming through hands-on practice.

📈 What I’m Learning

Through these projects, I’m building experience with:
	•	Python basics (syntax, loops, conditionals)
	•	Organizing code using functions
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, encapsulation)
	•	Writing clear and structured console programs

📂 Featured Projects

🕹️ Rock Paper Scissors

A simple command-line game created to practice decision-making logic, user input handling, and program flow.

📐 Draw Rectangle (OOP)

An OOP practice project that uses classes to calculate area and perimeter, helping me understand encapsulation and class design.

👥 Employee Management System (OOP)

A console-based system for managing employee information. This project helped me learn how to design classes that represent real-world objects and manage multiple instances.

🎲 Roll Dice Game

A small interactive game using Python’s random module, loops, and user input to simulate rolling dice.

🌱 Final Note

These projects represent my learning process as a student. Each one helped me improve my logic, code structure, and confidence in Python. I plan to keep expanding this repository as I continue learning.
