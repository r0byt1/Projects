# Rock Paper Scissors — Python Project

## Overview
This project is a command-line Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python.
The player plays against the computer, and the program keeps track of the score
until the user decides to quit.

I created this project while learning Python as a beginner, with the goal of
practicing logic, functions, and user interaction.
