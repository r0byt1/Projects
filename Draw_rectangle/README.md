# ASCII Rectangle & Square Generator

## About the Project
This project is a beginner-level Python application that allows users to create,
draw, and resize rectangles and squares using ASCII symbols in the console.

I built this project while learning Python to better understand how
object-oriented programming works and how to structure a program logically.

## Why I Made This Project
I wanted to practice using Python classes and methods instead of writing
everything in one file with simple functions.  
This project helped me see how real programs are organized and how objects
can represent real-world concepts like shapes.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:

- How to create and use Python classes
- How constructors (`__init__`) work
- How to write methods that operate on object data
- The difference between filled and hollow shapes using loops
- How to validate user input to avoid errors
- How to separate program logic into different files
- How to improve code readability using meaningful names and comments

This project also helped me understand how small design decisions
can make code easier to extend and maintain.

## Features
- Create rectangles or squares
- Draw filled or hollow shapes using ASCII symbols
- Calculate area and perimeter
- Resize shapes after creation
- Input validation for safer execution
