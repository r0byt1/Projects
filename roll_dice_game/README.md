# Dice Game (Python)

## About the Project
This project is a simple turn-based dice game written in Python.
Multiple players take turns rolling a dice, trying to reach a target score
while managing the risk of losing points if they roll a 1.

I created this project to practice control flow, loops, and game logic.

## What I Learned
By working on this project, I learned:
- How to use loops to control game flow
- How to work with lists to store player data
- How to simulate randomness using Python
- How to validate user input
- How to manage game state across multiple turns

This project helped me understand how small rules combine
to create a complete and playable game.

## Game Rules
- 2 to 4 players can play
- Each player can roll the dice multiple times per turn
- Rolling a 1 ends the turn and loses all points gained that turn
- Players can stop rolling to save their points
- First player to reach 50 points wins

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Basic algorithms and control structures
