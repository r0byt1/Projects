# Employee Management System (Python)

## About the Project
This project is a simple employee management system written in Python.
It allows users to view employee information, update salaries,
and compare employees based on their monthly income.

I created this project to practice object-oriented programming
and to model real-world entities using classes.

## What I Learned
By working on this project, I learned:
- How to design a class to represent a real-world object
- How to use methods to encapsulate behavior
- How to override the `__str__` method for readable output
- How to compare objects using their attributes
- How to build a menu-driven console application
- How to handle user input and basic validation

This project helped me understand how OOP can be used
to organize code and make it easier to maintain and extend.

## Features
- View employee details
- Calculate annual salary
- Increase monthly salary by percentage
